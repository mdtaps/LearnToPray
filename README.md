# LearnToPray

Learn To Pray is an app to help people pray.

The app has three main areas.

1. Guided Prayer
- Guided Prayers are prayer prompts centered around a topic. After selecting a topic, you are given a list of prayer prompts for that topic. If you press "Start Praying", you will be guided to a prayer timer area where you can spend time praying, lead by each prompt. You can dismiss the prayer timer by pressing the Finish button or the 'X' in the top corner. You can also Pause the timer by pressing pause. There is a status bar across the top of the prayer prompts to let people know how far along they are in praying through the prompts.

2. Prayer Timer
- The Prayer Timer is simply a timer for your prayer. A user is prompted to set the time they'd like to pray for, and then they are about to start praying as the timer counts down. The page displays a Bible verse if not Guided Prayer is selected.

3. About the App
- This is a section to explain the app to users in a few words. It also gives users access to email the Learn to Pray developer and/or give a donation toward the free app.
